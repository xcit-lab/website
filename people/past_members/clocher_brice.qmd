## Bio
Fascinated by digital media at a young age, Brice completed a M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (INSA Lyon) with the firm intention to create experiences that are meaningful and benefit society. His belief in a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to creativity led him to hone his crafts in various European start-ups and universities, producing a wide range of digital systems from tangible crisis management tools to alternate reality games. After teaching game development as an artistic practice to design students, he co-funded a game studio (Bunny & Gnome) and released an educational game about trash sorting which won four awards and was exhibited in a digital art museum (Trash Monsters).
