To create a new alumni page, copy one of the existing `.qmd` files and rename it to `lastName_firstName.qmd`. Then, fill in the details in the new file.

You can also add a picture of the person by including an jpg file with the same name as the qmd fime (i.e., `lastName_firstName.qmd`). If no image is provided, `placeholder.png` will be used instead.
