## Hello! 

I'm *Morteza*, a researcher at the University of Luxembourg. I specialize in computational cognitive neuroscience and computer engineering, and enjoy working on projects that have an impact on aligning machines to human cognition (or the other way around).


I conducted my PhD in Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Luxembourg (Belval, Luxembourg) in partnership with Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (Leipzig, Germany); [my thesis](https://github.com/morteza/thesis) emphasizes a computationally grounded perspective on cognitive control in the human brain.


I'm currently developing tools for automated scientific workflows and large-scale data lakehouses, specifically designed for multimodal cognitive data. My primary interest is resting-state brain--when the brain is not engaged in any specific task.
