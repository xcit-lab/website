## Hi!

I’m Sophie, a UX researcher at the University of Luxembourg. 
I’m passionate about understanding how people think, feel, and interact with the world—particularly when it involves technology. My primary focus is to understand people’s need to design meaningful and ethical interactions.


I use a variety of research methods—such as user testing, surveys, and interviews for the classical ones—to ensure the user’s voice is heard throughout the design process. 


I enjoy discovering new fields. I’ve collaborated on a wide range of projects, including computer-based assessment (CBA), user-centric cybersecurity, digital art, game design, XR for off-highway machinery, sustainability… Every project offers a new opportunity to explore how design can impact people.
