## Hi!

I’m a doctoral researcher in psychology at the University of Luxembourg supervised by Prof. Cardoso-Leite. My work focuses on designing online examination systems that are both secure and user-friendly. We are designing digital strategies that effectively prevent student cheating during exams while upholding strong privacy protections and ensuring a smooth, positive test-taking experience - addressing key components of a fair and valid exam.

I take an interdisciplinary, mixed-method approach to designing and testing behavioral interventions. Using realistic and interactive interfaces, I explore how these interventions influence students’ behavior, ultimately aiming to develop digital exam systems that are fair, effective and privacy-conscious.

With my background in Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction, designing digital solutions that meet real user needs is my sweet spot. I'm also an AI and data science enthusiast, passionate about integrating cutting-edge tech into systems that positively impact people's lives.
