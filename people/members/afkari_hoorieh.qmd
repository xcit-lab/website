## 1. Hello, I’m Hoorieh


I explore the space where people meet technology. As an HCI researcher and R&D professional, I’m driven by a curiosity about human behavior and a passion for designing digital systems that respond to real needs, not just technical specs.


## 2. What I’m Working On (and Why)

Right now, at the University of Luxembourg, I explore how digital technologies can support and enhance human learning and behavior. At the heart of it, I care about impact: creating technology that makes a real difference in people’s lives.


## 3. The Journey

I completed my PhD in Human-Computer Interaction in Finland, focusing on medical technologies. My PhD thesis, The Potentials for Gaze-Based Interaction with the Surgical Microscope, is available [here](https://erepo.uef.fi/items/89d6fccc-3dc6-4ab2-9e6f-4eb0cb0aef7e). 

Since then, I’ve worked in applied research and development across UX and digital tools; work that led me to Luxembourg, where I continue exploring how people interact with technology.


## 4. Beyond Work

Understanding people has always been more than just part of my work; it’s something I genuinely care about. That’s why I pursued a coaching certification at the University of Cambridge, where I’ve built on my skills in listening, empathy, and communication.
Outside of work, I enjoy learning new languages, reading philosophy, and going for long walks. Traveling helps me see the world from different perspectives and reminds me how differently people live, think, and connect.
